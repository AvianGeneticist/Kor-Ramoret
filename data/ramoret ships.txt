	description "Kor Ramoret carriers are effectively their own self-contained fleets, with mixes of support and offensive craft. Though tiny, the Kei Rel Ul 7 packs a colossal gun for its size, enabling it to punch through multiple targets. A swarm of these fighters can quickly rip massed targets to shreds, leaving nothing left but pieces to be absorbed by the Kor Ramoret war machine."
